FastAPI router introspection helpers shared across the test suite.

These utilities abstract over the ``_IncludedRouter`` lazy-wrapper introduced
in FastAPI 0.137.0 so that tests work correctly against both FastAPI ≤ 0.136
(eager route expansion) and ≥ 0.137 (lazy ``_IncludedRouter`` wrappers).

def collect_routes(router) -> list[tuple[str, object, list]]:
    """Return ``(full_path, route, include_deps)`` triples for every leaf route on *router*.

    ``include_deps`` is the list of :class:`fastapi.params.Depends` objects
    accumulated from enclosing ``_IncludedRouter`` wrappers (FastAPI ≥ 0.137).
    On FastAPI ≤ 0.136 this list is always empty because ``include_router``
    copies dependencies directly onto each leaf route's ``.dependencies``.

    This covers both FastAPI versions for tests that inspect route dependencies:

    * FastAPI ≤ 0.136: check ``getattr(route, "dependencies", [])``
    * FastAPI ≥ 0.137: check ``include_deps``

    To get paths only: ``[p for p, *_ in collect_routes(router)]``.

    Args:
        router: Any ``fastapi.APIRouter`` instance.

    Returns:
        A list of ``(path_str, route_object, include_deps)`` triples.
