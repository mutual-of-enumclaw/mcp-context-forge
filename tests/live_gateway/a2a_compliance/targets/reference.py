Direct connection to the bundled ``a2a_echo_agent``: no gateway in
front, no federation hop. The ``ClientFactory.create_from_url`` call
resolves the well-known agent card, picks the JSON-RPC transport per
the card's advertised interfaces (the echo agent advertises JSON-RPC
only), and returns a connected ``a2a.client.Client``.

Construction uses a freshly-created ``httpx.AsyncClient`` per target
``client()`` invocation so concurrent tests don't share connection
pools — matters once parametrize-by-version doubles up the test count.

Phase 1 supports the ``jsonrpc`` transport literal only. To exercise
the SDK's gRPC transport against a future echo-agent build that
advertises gRPC, add ``"grpc"`` to the ``Transport`` literal and
extend ``supported_transports`` here; ``ClientFactory`` will pick the
right transport from the agent card automatically.
