"""Agent card structural compliance for A2A 0.3.0.

The A2A 0.3.0 ``AgentCard`` schema is fundamentally different from
1.0.0 — transport advertisement lives at the top level
(``protocol_version``, ``url``, ``preferred_transport``,
``additional_interfaces``) rather than in a ``supported_interfaces``
array. These tests assert on the v0.3.0 shape; the v1.0.0 sibling
under ``../v1_0_0/`` asserts the 1.0.0 shape on the same agent process
(the echo agent emits a 0.3.0-shaped card regardless of advertised
version — see A2A-GAP-002 for the 1.0.0 case).
