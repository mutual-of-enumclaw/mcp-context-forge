These assertions cover the response payload shape — what fields are
populated when the agent successfully echoes a message. The SDK
Client is used for round-trips so the assertions read at the Python
object level rather than the JSON wire level. Wire-level
field-presence assertions live in ``test_agent_card.py``.
