Phase 1 scope: raw-httpx against the reference target. The card-shape
contract is wire-level, so we drive it without the SDK abstraction.
When gateway native A2A passthrough lands (A2A-GAP-001) these checks
should be re-parametrized over the full target matrix via an
``agent_card_url`` resolver per target.
