A2A 1.0.0 carries authentication discovery on the card via
``securitySchemes`` (map) and ``securityRequirements`` (list of
requirement references).

Per the protobuf JSON convention, default-valued fields (empty map,
empty list) MAY be omitted on the wire — absence is semantically
equivalent to "no auth required". This suite validates *shape when
present* rather than mandating explicit emission (the earlier strict
assertions were the basis of A2A-GAP-003, since reclassified as a
test-side spec misreading).
