Shared fixtures for the live-gateway cpex plugin E2E suites.

Provides an authenticated admin HTTP client and a provisioned virtual server
backed by the ``fast-time-server`` federation gateway. The gateway under test
is started out-of-band by the plugin-integration.yml workflow with a
single-plugin enforce config; these fixtures only set up the request path the
tests exercise.

    Creates a throwaway team, registers the fast-time-server federation gateway

    tools to sync, creates a virtual server over them, and tears everything down
    on exit. The ``echo`` tool round-trips arbitrary text, which lets the plugin
    suites drive the gateway's plugin hooks with controlled payloads. The team
    scoping is required by the tool-plugin-bindings enforcement path and is
