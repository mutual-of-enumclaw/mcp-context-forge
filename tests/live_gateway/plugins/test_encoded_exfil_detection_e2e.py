End-to-end gateway test for the cpex-encoded-exfil-detection plugin.

Drives the plugin's ``tool_post_invoke`` hook by echoing tool output through a
live gateway and asserts that:

* a tool result containing a suspicious base64-encoded payload is **blocked**,
  and
* a clean payload passes through unchanged.

The same assertions run against **both** enforcement paths, selected by the
``PLUGIN_ENFORCEMENT`` env var (set by the workflow matrix):

* ``static`` — the gateway boots with EncodedExfilDetector in ``enforce`` mode
  (config derived from ``plugins/config.yaml``), and
* ``binding`` — the gateway boots with EncodedExfilDetector ``disabled`` and a
  runtime tool-plugin-binding flips it to ``enforce`` for the test's team+tool.

Both paths surface the identical block message, so one test body covers both.
The cpex plugin is never imported here — the gateway loads it from
``PLUGINS_CONFIG_FILE``; ``plugin_enforcement`` asserts it actually loaded so a
broken build fails loudly instead of skipping.
