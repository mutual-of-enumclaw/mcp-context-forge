End-to-end gateway test for the cpex-retry-with-backoff plugin.

Unlike the blocking plugins, retry-with-backoff does not reject a call - it
inspects the tool result on the ``tool_post_invoke`` hook and, when the result
is a (retryable) failure, asks the gateway to re-invoke the tool after a backoff
delay, up to ``max_retries`` times. This suite drives that behaviour with the
fast-time-server ``flaky`` tool, which returns ``isError=true`` for the first
``fail_times`` calls of a given ``key`` and then succeeds. Because the gateway
re-sends identical arguments on each retry, all attempts of one logical call
share a ``key`` and increment the same upstream counter, so the final result is
deterministic:

* with ``fail_times == max_retries`` the budget is just enough - the call
  eventually **succeeds** (a single non-retried call would have returned the
  error, so success proves the retries happened), and
* with ``fail_times > max_retries`` the budget is exhausted and the last
  **failure** surfaces unchanged.

The same assertions run against **both** enforcement paths, selected by the
``PLUGIN_ENFORCEMENT`` env var (set by the workflow matrix):

* ``static`` - the gateway boots with RetryWithBackoffPlugin in ``enforce`` mode
  (config derived from ``plugins/config.yaml``), and
* ``binding`` - the gateway boots with RetryWithBackoffPlugin ``disabled`` and a
  runtime tool-plugin-binding flips it to ``enforce`` for the test's team+tool.

Both paths bind the identical production config block, so one test body covers
both. The cpex plugin is never imported here - the gateway loads it from
``PLUGINS_CONFIG_FILE``; ``plugin_enforcement`` asserts it actually loaded so a
broken build fails loudly instead of skipping.
