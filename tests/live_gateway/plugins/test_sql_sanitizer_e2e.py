End-to-end gateway test for the native SQL Sanitizer plugin.

Unlike the other suites in this directory, SQL Sanitizer is **not** a cpex wheel
- it ships in the gateway repo at ``plugins/sql_sanitizer/`` and is loaded as a
native plugin. With the committed config (``block_on_violation: true``,
``strip_comments: true``) it scans configured fields for risky SQL and:

* **blocks** dangerous statements (DROP/TRUNCATE/ALTER/GRANT/REVOKE and
  DELETE/UPDATE without a WHERE clause), and
* **sanitizes** otherwise-safe SQL by stripping ``--`` line and ``/* */`` block
  comments in place (a non-blocking mutation).

This suite drives both behaviours over the plugin's tool hook
(``tool_pre_invoke``) via the fast-time-server ``echo`` tool - dangerous SQL is
blocked, safe SQL round-trips unchanged, and commented SQL is echoed back with
its comments stripped.

The plugin's ``prompt_pre_fetch`` hook is intentionally not covered here: a
blocked prompt currently surfaces as an unrelated ``ServerResult`` validation
error rather than a clean violation (a gateway-side issue), so there is no
stable contract to assert against.

The committed config scans ``fields: [sql, query, statement]``; the echo tool's
argument is ``message``, so both enforcement paths add ``message`` to ``fields``
(the static path via ``make_enforce_config --config-override``, the bindings
path via ``config_overrides`` here) so the tool argument is actually scanned.

The tool assertions run against **both** enforcement paths, selected by the
``PLUGIN_ENFORCEMENT`` env var (set by the workflow matrix):

* ``static`` - the gateway boots with SQLSanitizer in ``enforce`` mode (config
  derived from ``plugins/config.yaml``), and
* ``binding`` - the gateway boots with SQLSanitizer ``disabled`` and a runtime
  tool-plugin-binding flips it to ``enforce`` for the test's team+tool.
